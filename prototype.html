				<h2>> Spelling Bee</h2>
				<p class='tags'>Product Design, Visual Design, Web Development</p>
				<p>The NYT Games Expansion Team is currently exploring new audiences and opportunities by rapidly prototyping and user testing game concepts.</p>
				<p>As part of that effort, I recently spent two weeks designing and developing a prototype of Spelling Bee that was tested on the mobile web homepage of The New York Times.</p>

				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Spelling Bee is one of the variety puzzles found in The New York Times Magazine. Notoriously difficult, it's usually played over multiple sessions - a lot of players we interviewed described their routine of leaving the magazine out on their coffee table so that they could come back to it throughout the day.</p>
				<p>Our challenge was to see if we could recreate this analog experience in a digital game.</p>
				<h3>Process</h3>
				<p>When it comes to process, the Expansion team values speed above all else - we aim to validate or discard ideas as quickly as possible by building MVPs and testing them within a 2-week timeframe.</p>
				<p>After an initial kickoff meeting with our game designer and product manager, I designed and coded a prototype in three days and did a round of internal user testing to answer some gameplay questions.</p>

				<p>The feedback from the user testing was pretty unanimous - the game, an exact interpretation of the original rules of Spelling Bee, was too difficult.</p>
				<p>Taking that feedback into account, we made the rules and scoring a little less rigid and I built a second iteration of the prototype.</p>
				<h3>User Testing</h3>
				<p>Once the second iteration was complete, we ran a 2-week A/B test of Spelling Bee on the mobile web homepage of nytimes.com that was an overall success. Excitingly enough, we found that a significant number of players were coming back to the prototype multiple times a day and our test group showed signs of habituation by the end of the test.</p>
				<p>We're currently figuring out next steps for our beloved Bee, but for now, please enjoy some of my personal favorite feedback emails:</p>
				<blockquote>I love the spelling bee game! My best friend and I play every night and text each other our scores through the evening and then compare our word lists. It's really great fun. Please keep it around.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Very fun! I got my 94 year old dad into it. He's a New York Times cross world puzzler from way back!
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I am completely hooked on this game!! My fiance and i are long distance for the summer and sending our spelling bee answers to one another quickly became a very loving ritual for us! We can't wait until the game is back!! Thanks!
