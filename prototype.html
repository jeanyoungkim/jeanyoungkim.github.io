				<h2>> Spelling Bee</h2>
				<p class='tags'>Product Design, Visual Design, Web Development</p>
				<p>The NYT Games Expansion Team is currently exploring new audiences and opportunities by rapidly prototyping and user testing game concepts.</p>
				<p>As part of that effort, I recently spent two weeks designing and developing a prototype of Spelling Bee that was tested on the mobile web homepage of The New York Times.</p>

				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Spelling Bee is one of the variety puzzles found in The New York Times Magazine. Notoriously difficult, it's usually played over multiple sessions - a lot of players we interviewed described their routine of leaving the magazine out on their coffee table so that they could come back to it throughout the day.</p>
				<p>Our challenge was to see if we could recreate this analog experience in a digital game.</p>
				<h3>Process</h3>
				<p>When it comes to process, the Expansion team values speed above all else - we aim to validate or discard ideas as quickly as possible by building MVPs and testing them within a 2-week timeframe.</p>
				<p>After an initial kickoff meeting with our game designer and product manager, I designed and coded a prototype in three days and did a round of internal user testing to answer some gameplay questions.</p>

				<p>The feedback from the user testing was pretty unanimous - the game, an exact interpretation of the original rules of Spelling Bee, was too difficult.</p>
				<p>Taking that feedback into account, we made the rules and scoring a little less rigid and I built a second iteration of the prototype.</p>
				<h3>User Testing</h3>
				<p>Once the second iteration was complete, we ran a 2-week A/B test of Spelling Bee on the mobile web homepage of nytimes.com that was an overall success. Excitingly enough, we found that a significant number of players were coming back to the prototype multiple times a day and our test group showed signs of habituation by the end of the test.</p>
				<p>We're currently figuring out next steps for our beloved Bee, but for now, please enjoy some of my personal favorite feedback emails:</p>
				<blockquote>I love the spelling bee game! My best friend and I play every night and text each other our scores through the evening and then compare our word lists. It's really great fun. Please keep it around.</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					Very fun! I got my 94 year old dad into it. He's a New York Times cross world puzzler from way back!
				</blockquote>
				<blockquote>
					I am completely hooked on this game!! My fiance and i are long distance for the summer and sending our spelling bee answers to one another quickly became a very loving ritual for us! We can't wait until the game is back!! Thanks!

				<h2>> Design Sprint: Daily Flow</h2>
				<p class='tags'>Product Design, Visual Design</p>
				<p>Last October, a subset of the Games team had a weeklong product ideation session inspired by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures' Design Sprint</a>. I acted as the technology representative in a 7-person group that spanned product & project management, design, and editorial.</p>
				<h3>Setting a Goal</h3>
				<p>The first step of our process was actually to reset our goal. Our pre-ordained goal was to answer the question "how can we help Crosswords users find more value in our product?"</p>
				<p>Looking at this goal from a human centered design perspective, we saw some major issues and had a lot of questions: Why is this entirely business driven? Are we trying to design for *every* Crosswords user? What sort of value are we trying to provide?</p>
				<p>After a quick reset and a brainstorming session, we came up a new challenge for the week:</p>
				<p><i>
					Create an experience beyond the Mini Crossword that allows users to feel accomplished every day, targeted towards people who can only solve the Mini.
				</i></p>
				<h3>Ideation</h3>
				<p>After a couple of days of interviewing experts from marking, editorial, and engineering about the ins and outs of our product, we spent a day rapidly churning out wireframes of our ideas. A round of voting followed, and we decided to pursue one of my sketches - a concept called The Daily Flow (I know, I know, the name is weird. It was never meant to last forever!)</p>
				<img width="700px" src="./projects/assets/flow/paper.png" alt="Daily Flow Sketch">
				<p>It's a pretty well known fact that there's a huge barrier to entry for The Crossword. Since so much of the content is fact-based, the entire game tends to be all or nothing - you either know the answer or you don't.</p>
				<p>Interestingly enough, Deb Amlen, the editor of the Wordplay blog, told us that she firmly believes that "anyone can solve a Crossword; they just have to learn how!"</p>
				<p>With those two things in mind, I designed The Daily Flow as a series of mini games based on crossword clues that can be played either as a standalone experience or a way to get a head start on the Daily Crossword.</p>

				<h3>User Testing</h3>
				<p>At the end of the week, we had a paper prototype of the full Daily Flow experience - a user plays ~16 mini games and, at the end of the game, is given the option to continue to the Daily Crossword, where they'll see a grid pre-populated with however many of the 16 anwers they got right.</p>
				<p>We tested our prototype on a number of different people who play the Mini puzzle and found that they enjoyed the mini games as a standalone experience and were particularly delighted when their pre-populated Crossword was revealed.</p>
				<p>The next steps for this project are to create a digital version to test habituation and figure out if this can be used as an onboarding tool. Stay tuned!</p>
