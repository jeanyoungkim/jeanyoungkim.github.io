				<h1>Spelling Bee</h1>
		    <p>The NYT Games Expansion Team is currently exploring new audiences and opportunities by rapidly prototyping and user testing game concepts.</p>
				<p>As part of that effort, I recently spent two weeks designing and developing a prototype of Spelling Bee that was tested on the mobile web homepage of The New York Times.</p>

				<h1>Design Sprint: Daily Flow</h1>
		    <p>Last October, the Games team had a weeklong product ideation session inspired by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gv.com/sprint/">Google Ventures' Design Sprint</a>.</p>
				<p>Our goal was to create an experience beyond the Mini Crossword that allows users to feel accomplished every day, targeted to people who can currently only solve the Mini.</p>
				<p>The resulting product was a paper prototype of <a href="http://jeanyoungkim.com/projects/daily-flow.pdf" target="_blank">The Daily Flow</a> - a series of minigames based on crossword clues that can be played either as a standalone experience or a way to get a head start on the Daily Crossword.</p>

				<h1>Matter Ventures</h1>
		    <p>In 2016, The New York Times partnered with <a target="_blank" href="http://matter.vc">Matter.vc</a> and participated in their five month design thinking program. Two colleagues and I represented NYT and worked alongside the startups in Matter's program to design a new product for The Times.</p>
				<p>We began by interviewing casual Times readers to isolate a compelling user need and challenged ourselves to answer the question "How can we help people spend bits of free time in a fulfilling way?"</p>
				<p>The result was the concept of mood-based prompts - "Make me feel better about the world," "Give me something to talk about over dinner," etc - that lead to curated collections of stories and multimedia content.</p>
				<p>The program culminated in a Demo Day at Google where we pitched our project to an audience of VCs and internal stakeholders. We continued to test the concept after the program ended and are currently figuring out next steps.</p>

				<h1>The New York Times Crossword</h1>
		    <p>Over the last year, the Games team has worked on replatforming our web app from a proprietary PHP/JS framework to a Node stack using React and Redux.</p>
				<p>We successfully launched the replatformed <a target="_blank" href="https://nytimes.com/crosswords/game/mini">Crossword page</a> in May and are continuing work on the rest of the site.</p>
